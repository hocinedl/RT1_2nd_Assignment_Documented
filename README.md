## Documentation using Sphinx

For the documentation of your assignment, you have utilized Sphinx. Sphinx is a powerful documentation generation tool that allows you to create structured and well-formatted documentation for your codebase. Sphinx uses reStructuredText (reST) markup language to write the documentation, which is then transformed into various output formats such as HTML, PDF, and ePub.

To set up Sphinx for your project, follow these steps:

1. Install Sphinx: Use the package manager of your choice (e.g., pip or conda) to install Sphinx. For example, you can run `pip install sphinx` in your terminal.
2. Initialize Sphinx: Open a terminal in the root directory of your project and run `sphinx-quickstart`. This command will create a `source` directory containing the configuration file (`conf.py`) and the main documentation file (`index.rst`).
3. Write your documentation: Open the `index.rst` file in the `source` directory and start documenting your project. Sphinx provides various directives and markup syntax to structure your documentation, add code samples, and create cross-references.
4. Build the documentation: Once you have written your documentation, navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal and run `make html`. Sphinx will generate the HTML output in the `build` directory.
5. View the documentation: Open the generated HTML files in a web browser to view your documentation.

Remember to include any necessary installation instructions or dependencies in your documentation, making it easier for others to use and understand your project.

## Jupyter Notebook with Widgets and Matplotlib

In this assignment, you have utilized Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and analysis. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. 

To run Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook: Use the package manager of your choice to install Jupyter Notebook. For example, you can run `pip install jupyter` in your terminal.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook files are located. Run the command `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter server.
3. Interact with the Notebook: Once the server is running, a web browser will open with the Jupyter Notebook interface. From here, you can create new notebooks or open existing ones. Notebooks consist of cells, which can contain code, Markdown text, or other elements. Use the code cells to write and execute your Python code, including the usage of widgets and Matplotlib for interactive visualizations.
4. Save and export: Make sure to save your work regularly. You can save the notebook in the `.ipynb` format and export it as a PDF or HTML file for sharing or submission.

Remember to include clear explanations and comments within your Jupyter Notebook, making it easier for others to follow your analysis and understand the purpose of each code block. Utilize widgets and Matplotlib effectively to enhance the interactivity and visualization of your data.

## Statistical Analysis

The third part of this assignment focuses on statistical analysis. Statistical analysis involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. It enables you to draw meaningful conclusions from data and make informed decisions.

To perform statistical analysis, follow these general steps:

1. Define your research question or objective: Clearly state the question or objective that you want to address through statistical analysis.
2. Collect and prepare the data: Gather the relevant data
